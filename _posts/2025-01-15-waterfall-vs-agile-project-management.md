## What is Project Management
Inorder to really grasp what Agile is, we need to first discuss the general concept of project management.

Project management is the use of specific knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to deliver something of value to people. A Project Manager is a person who uses project management methods to manage projects. IT project managers traditionally used a project management methodology known as 'waterfall' to manage their projects, however this methodology is no longer able to meet the unpredicatble nature of the tech sector. This is where 'Agile' project management mentholdoy comes into the picture. 

## Waterfal
The waterfall project management approach entails a clearly defined sequence of execution with project phases that do not advance until a phase receives final approval. Here're some general characteristics of waterfall:

- teams work more independently (not required to be in continuous communication or giving reports continuously)
- requirements are gathered at the start of the project and a project plan is created per those requirements.
- each phase of the project cascades into the next
- ideal for projects with fixed requirements, thereby making it a `predictive approach to project management`

## Agile
Agile project management is an iterative approach to managing projects and focuses on continuous releases and incorporating  feedback (from stakeholders and development team) with every iteration. Here're are some general characteristics of agile:

- provide value to customers in the shortest amount of time by focusing on small/incremental releases
- if done correctly, teams that adopt agile increase their development speed, expand collaboration, and foster the ability to
- better respond to market trends
- ideal for projects with changing requirements, thereby making it an `adaptive approach to project management`

## Why is Agile Popular?
As you can see, the Agile methodology is a great approach for managing IT projects to meet todays demands. It's safe to say that modern businesses are software driven and need an adaptive approach to managing changing need. The goal of Agile development is to give teams the ability to create and respond to change. `It's popularity within IT is solely because it provides a way of dealing with and ultimately succeeding in an uncertain and turbulent environment; where pivots are more common than you'd think.`

At this point it is important to note that the term 'Agile' is really just a philosophy. The Agile philosophy centers around continuous incremental improvement through small and frequent releases. You can't really "go agile" in a few days or weeks, as it takes dedication from the whole team to change the way they think about delivering value to your customers.
